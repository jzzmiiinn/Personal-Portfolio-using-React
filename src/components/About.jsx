          <p>
            Hi! I’m Yasmin Ali, a Software Engineering student at Jimma University with a strong passion for web development and UI/UX design. I have solid experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, creating responsive and interactive websites that are both functional and user-friendly.

            I enjoy crafting clean, intuitive designs and ensuring a smooth user experience, while also writing efficient, well-structured code. My projects reflect my dedication to bridging the gap between design and development.

            Currently, I am expanding my skills to become a full-stack developer, eager to learn backend technologies, database management, and deployment practices, so I can build complete web applications from scratch. I thrive on learning new technologies and turning ideas into real, working solutions.
